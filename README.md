The Business/Organization & Opportunity
Netflix is a subscription-based streaming service that allows its members to watch tv shows and movies without commercials on an internet-connected device (ref. netflix.com). There is an opportunity to optimize the selection of tv shows and movies for the business to increase member subscriptions and/or stock prices by analyzing the current lists of shows/movies, list of Netflix original shows/movies, the IMDB scores of the shows/movies and the stock prices data.

Problem
The system helps us to find out what the most popular genre of movies/shows are in the current Netflix shows/movies selection; whether the popular videos align with high IMDB scores; whether Netflix originals have higher IMDB scores; and if there is a positive relationship between high score movies/shows to the stock prices.

Conclusion
The analytics built in Tableau using data transformed by the data source helped answer the problems we identified during the planning section and learned from data analysis that there are room to improve the movie/show selections in genres that received high IMDB rating, produce more high quality Netflix original movies/shows and increase movies/shows from countries that have higher than average IMDB ratings to attract more and retain existing subscriptions.

During this assignment, I got the opportunity to work on tasks that are practical and identical to real life project and it was a tremendous and valuable experience. I have learned how to figure out what directions to seek answers when I was stuck, effectively ask and follow-up with questions, perform researches (mostly online) using keywords and quickly acquired the necessary skillsets to solve various problems I ran into. I believe this will be beneficial for me as a Data Analyst or any other positions in the future. If I had to do it all over again, I would still be proactively getting involved in as much of the project as I could, working diligently with and motivating all the stakeholders.
